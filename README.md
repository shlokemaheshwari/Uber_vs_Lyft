# Uber_vs_Lyft_price_prediction
### Project Overview
This project aims to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a comprehensive dataset encompassing various facets of Uber and Lyft operations in Boston, Massachusetts. Leveraging statistical and visual techniques, we seek to uncover patterns, trends, and key factors influencing ride-sharing dynamics in the city. Furthermore, the project endeavors to develop a price prediction model for Uber and Lyft services based on the derived insights, offering valuable predictions for users and strategic guidance for both companies in the competitive Boston market.
